## Welcome to RoboForest

RoboForest is an idea to learn, teach and develop robotics and machine learning for the purpose of re-creating sustainable habitat for the earth's species. The challenge is so large. Since industrialization, humans have destroyed much of the natural systems that support biological life of earth. Human society is driven by continued economic growth and consumption. Although trade and economic growth help maintain peace, the earth's natural and biological systems have not been protected. How can we reverse this trend in the face of ever-increasing population and accelerating of human consumption?

AI and robotics has scary potential to harm humans and the earth. But RoboForest believes that AI and robotics can be used for good. And the best way to make sure that AI and robotics are used for good, is to ensure good people use AI and robotics.

So RoboForest aims to engage, excite and educate everyone in the world of AI and robotics for the purpose of re-creating sustainable habitit. But habitats are diverse and vary from location to location.

How will we do that?

We want to create a community of collaborators that use, develop and share code from RoboForest. We need this decentralised model in order to allow creative adaptations by developers to ensure our tools and systems are suitable for different habititats.

We have a plan, but as always our plan will change. Right now, we have identified seven broad activities:

### Characterize Biodiversity
We have highly-skilled, passionate people in universities, consultancies and governments working hard to protect and restore species. These people work with the most advanced tools and we need to get them engaged to fully characterise the biodiversity of their local habitats.

### Identify areas
Satellite imagery will soon capture sub-millimetre resolution images and make available to many people. These images and time-series analysis will show disused areas that can be classified for re-creating habitat.

We will also need some clever lawyers and public figures to negotiate agreements to access or obtain these areas.

### Restore habitat
Robotics and flexible manufacturing techniques are key here. We want to not only program the robots to plant habitat, but to build the code to build the robots using 3D printing techniques or other available manufacturing techniques (not everything needs to be 3D printed!).

### Support habitat
IoT, computer vision, ML and robots here.

### Re-introduce animals
Humans here

### Manage pests and weeds
Robots to manage pests

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kenyandoppio/RoboForest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
